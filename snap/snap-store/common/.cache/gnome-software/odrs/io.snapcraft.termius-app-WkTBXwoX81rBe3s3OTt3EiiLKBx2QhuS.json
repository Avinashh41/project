        "description": "I have been using Termius on Windows 10 for a couple of years, Windows 11 and Ubuntu for the last year. When I started using the app it was possible to use it as a stand alone app for free or as a pay for app to network it. I used the stand alone version for a very long time. I have been using the pay for version for the last two years. Here's my $0.02.\nThe networked version is great if you have many machines you need access to. I have a few servers in my home lab with lots of cpu, memory, and disk space which allows me a fairly large Red Hat virtual lab running across three ProxMox data centers. I also keep a Windows 2016 AD domain and run some machines on Hyper-V. To a lesser extent, I keep a few machines on a VirtualBox lab and a VMWare Workstation 17 lab. \nIn all cases, I divide my labs into Termius groups to make the numbers managable. Termius is sweet as I just installed this Ubuntu workstation client on my Dell Workstation as a Hyper-V virtual machine. I added Termius and logged in and had instant access to all of my linux and BSD boxes via ssh.\nMy one reservation is: I don't like the preset Hot Key Ctl+L. This is set to Local Terminal in Windows instead of clear terminal as is common in a Linux terminal. I had to turn off the Hot Key function as it was making me crazy every time it launched a local terminal.\n I don't like paying for the app either but developers have to eat too. Try to keep your perspective. If you download an app for free and you like the app enough to using regularly then you should buy them a cup of coffee or two every now and then. I certainly don't mind paying a reasonable amount to use a nice app. I pay for Office360, Red Hat Developer, Wikipedia, ProxMox, BeeKeeper, DropBox, VMWare, fre:ac, rufus, AIMP, Notepad++, Mozilla, Ubuntu, Debian, Putty and other apps I use on a regular basis. Free isn't free as there is a cost built in there somewhere. Remeber, someone spent a lot of time to make that nice OS or App you are using. They also spend a lot of time answering your questions and fixing bugs or adding features you request.",

        "description": "Granted, I'm using the free version. Cannot add a key from my local ~/.ssh folder for starters, as I get an access denied from the snap (making it and its contents world readable, just to test this, did not help). Furthermore, cannot connect to KVM guests using the generated names such as \"machine.local\" though IP address works fine. Interface is confusing/inconvenient, as you can't get to the keychain preferences using the menu bar, but have to use the down arrow. When I get there, I can import my private key file (id_rsa) using the File dialog, but if I want my public key, I have to paste it in from a text editor as no file dialog option is available. Apparently, I don't have the same idea how this should work as the developers do. I really wanted to like this, too. In short, when it works, it seems to work great, but getting it to work is more trouble than just using the command-line to begin with, so it kind of defeats the whole point. If these things get amended, then I'll happily reconsider.",
